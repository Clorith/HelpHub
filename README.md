# HelpHub

## What?

HelpHub is going to be the new portal for all WordPress user documentation that currently resides on the [WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/). This repo is where we will be managing development of this new portal.

## How?

You can get involved in development (or any other aspect of the project) by attending our weekly meetings in the #docs channel of [the Making WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) every Tuesday at 14:00 UTC.

To use this repo, simply create a new WordPress site on your local machine (using whatever development environment suits you), then empty out the `wp-content` folder and clone this repo into it.

Anyone is welcome to fork the repo and send pull requests, but the project contributors (listed below) have write access directly to the repo. All pull requests will be discussed and must be approved by the project lead before merge. **Contributors will be responsible for merging their own pull requests once the contribution has been approved.**
