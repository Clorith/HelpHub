# HelpHub

This is where we will be managing development of the new WordPress user documentation portal, dubbed HelpHub.

You can get involved in development (or any other aspect of the project) by attending our weekly meetings in the #docs channel of [the Making WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) every Tuesday at 14:00 UTC.
